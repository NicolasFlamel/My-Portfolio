# My Portfolio

## Description

I build this project so I can showcase my web projects to potential employers when looking for a part-time or full time job. Showing my skills and talents as a web developer. At the moment I don't have projects to showcase so I have filled it with placeholders but it is easily replaceable once I have a larger amount of projects completed.
